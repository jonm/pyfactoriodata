# pyfactoriodata

This is a set of scripts that can take the raw data export from Factorio, as found
on the [Factorio Wiki](https://wiki.factorio.com/Data.raw), and produce a set of
Python libraries that can be used for further scripting.

# Prerequisites

1. `make`
2. `awk`
3. `lua`
4. `python3`
5. `pip3`
6. `virtualenv` (on my system this was a system package called
   `python3.10-venv`)

Then you can:
```
$ virtualenv -p python3 venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt .
```

# Instructions

If you want to start all the way from the beginning, download the raw
data export, and call this `data.raw`. Then, run `make`. This will:

1. Convert `data.raw` into `data.lua`, a Lua script that can export the
   raw data as JSON. There are various cleanup activities that must be
   done to accomplish this successfully, including:
   * Substituting `inf` or `-inf` into numbers that are valid JSON.
   * Turning sparse arrays into dictionaries/tables keyed by the string
     representations of the original integer array indices.
   * Converting mixed tables (i.e. ones that have keys that suggest they
     can be treated as Lua arrays as well as keys (usually strings) for
     other properties.
   
   Details of the cleanup operations are in `util.lua`.

2. Run `data.lua` to output `data.json`.

3. Run `generate.py` to create the hardcoded instances/constants of various
   Python classes.

4. Run `python3 -m build` to produce the distributable Python packages.
